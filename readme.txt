#### List and edit Gravity Form entries on the front end

Front end editing of entries has allways been a problem in Gravity Forms. Solutions that exist are buggy and not very feature rich. Gravity Forms Sticky List aims to fill this gap and provide a simple and solid way to view, edit and delete entry submissions on the front end. The goal of the plugin is not to to display entries in a fancy way (excelent <a href="https://gravityview.co/">GravityViews</a> allready does that brilliantly) but to provide a simple, lightweight and rock solid way to list, edit and delete submissions on the front-end. Lists can be embedded in any post or page and you can have as many lists as you want in a single page.

#### Delete Gravity Form submissions from front end

Gravity Forms Sticky List uses a simple ajax approach to deleting entries. Deleted entries are moved to trash or permanently deleted depending on the per form settings. 

#### Sort and search entries

Sticky List uses the fast and lightweight <a href="http://www.listjs.com/">list.js</a> to allow for sorting the list and searching the entries. Searching entries is fast and results are updated immediately. 

#### Conditional confirmations and notifications

Gravity Forms Sticky List adds conditional confirmations and notifications so that different confirmations messages can be shown depending on if a new entry was submitted or if an existiong entry was updated, and diffrent email notifications can be sent if an entry was added, updated or deleted.

#### Styling the list

Sticky List ships with a minimal stylesheet that is easy to override. The table has the class of `.sticky-list` attached to it which can be used to override the default styles. The stylesheet is located in `sticky-list/css/sticky-list_styles.css` in the plugins main directory.

#### Usage

1. Upload and activate the plugin
2. Go to the settings page of a form and click the Sticky List settings tab
3. Enable Sticky List for that form att choose your settings
4. Go to the form editor and select what fields should be displayed in the list
5. Put the shortcode in a page/post with the corresponding form id, i.e: <br>`[stickylist id="1"]`

#### Developers
There is a fully documented version of the plugin on the <a href="https://github.com/13pixlar/sticky-list">Github project page</a>. This plugin is Open Source and pull requests are welcome.

**Note:** <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a> version 1.8.19.2+ is required for this plugin.

#### Known bugs

**File field does not display uploaded file when viewed or edited**<br>
This will be addressed in a future version of Sticky List.

== Installation ==

1. Upload extracted folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Choose the required Sticky List settings on the individual form settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The list is empty, why? =

You need to check "Show in list" on the fields that you would like to appear in the list. This is done in the form editor when edtiting a field.

= The View and Edit links don't do anything =

In Sticky List settings for that form: make sure that you select the page/post where the FORM is embedded. The actual form is then used to view and/or edit the entries.

= Where are the Sticky List settings? =

Sticky List is activated on a per form basis. The settings are located in the individual form settings, right under Notifications.

= I still cant find any sticky list settings =

Make sure that the plugin is activated **and** that your Gravity Forms version is 1.8.19.2 or higher.

There is a bug in the Gravity Forms API in pervious versions that prevented fields from getting saved in the entry. The bug was fixed in version 1.8.19.2 of Gravity Forms. Make sure you use an <a href="http://www.gravityhelp.com/downloads/">updated version</a>. If you are not able to update Gravity Forms you can easily apply the patch manually to `plugins/gravityforms/includes/api.php`

On line `510`, remove 
`
if (empty($entry_id))
    $entry_id = $entry["id"];
`
and replace with
`
if (empty($entry_id)) {
    $entry_id = $entry["id"];
}else{
    $entry["id"] = $entry_id;
}
`

You also need to change the Sticky List plugin file to requre an earlier version of Gravity Forms

In `plugins/gravity-forms-sticky-list/sticky-list.php` on line `23` change 
`
protected $_min_gravityforms_version = "1.8.19.2";
`
to you version of Gravity Forms. Note that this change will be lost when updating Sticky List. Therefore its absolutely recommended that you update Gravity Forms when using this plugin on a production site.
